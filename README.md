![Screenshot 2025-01-03 230206](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/063f08a9-a64a-4537-893d-d9401a7ad847)

This Online Learning Platform allows users to engage in video-based learning, participate in quizzes to test their knowledge, and track their progress. The platform is designed to be simple, user-friendly, and interactive.

Key Features:
Video Lessons:

Users can watch video lessons embedded within the platform.
Each video comes with a "Mark as Watched" button to track the user's progress.
Quizzes:

After completing a video, users can take a quiz to assess their understanding.
The quiz includes multiple-choice questions, and the user’s responses are checked for correctness.
Progress Tracking:

Progress is updated based on two main actions: watching the video and completing the quiz.
The platform displays the user’s completion percentage, which reflects their overall progress.
Technologies Used:

HTML is used for the structure of the page, organizing sections like video lessons, quizzes, and progress tracking.
CSS is utilized to style the content and make the platform visually appealing. Responsive design ensures the platform works well on both desktop and mobile devices.
JavaScript is responsible for interactivity: updating the progress, managing quiz answers, and tracking if a video has been watched.
Progress Storage:

The user’s progress is stored in the browser’s localStorage, ensuring that the platform remembers the user's progress even after refreshing or closing the browser.
Use Case:
Learners: Students can engage with the video lessons, take quizzes, and track their learning journey through progress indicators.
Platform Owner: Can expand by adding more lessons, quizzes, and interactive elements as the platform evolves.
Technology Stack:
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Data Storage: LocalStorage (for tracking user progress)
Project Goals:
Interactive Learning: Create a dynamic learning environment that engages students through videos and quizzes.
Progress Visualization: Provide learners with immediate feedback and track their performance.
Responsiveness: Ensure the platform is accessible on various devices, including mobile phones and desktops.
Scalability:
This platform can be extended with more advanced features, such as:
User Authentication to save progress across devices.
Backend integration to store user data and quiz results.
Additional Learning Resources, such as downloadable materials or interactive tutorials.
This project provides a foundation for building a more comprehensive online learning environment that can be enhanced with further interactivity and personalized learning paths.
